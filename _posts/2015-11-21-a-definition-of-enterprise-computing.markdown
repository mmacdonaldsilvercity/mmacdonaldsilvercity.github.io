# A Working Definition of Enterprise Computing

Since I'm likely to be talking about it in other postings, I'll define what I mean by Enterprise Computing.

In my way of thinking, I don't consider customer-facing applications -- regardless of size or arrival/throughput rates -- as Enterprise Computing applications.  Critical, complex, a vital component of some business models, yes.  But customer-facing fashion is fickle and rapidly changing, and that should be built into the application expectations regarding longevity and costs for rewrites.  Now the underlying architecture and tools that support those ... Now we're talking.  

A further pre-note:  Developer-oriented, publicly exposed API's fall into the same category.  These are products, not: **The infrastructure that an ongoing business relies upon in order to promote and deliver its products.**

## Enterprise Computing:
* Maintains central repositories of organization-wide data
* Provides access to data and services used by internal and external facing applications
* Is required to provide for the needs of multiple sub-organizations with guidance and support for common infrastructure, architectures, standards, procedures and technical capabilities
* Is subject to an eternal pendulum balancing between centrailzed vs. decentralized decision making and authority
* Provides the infrastructure and standards to support all of the above, and including required cross-application messaging support
* Is expected to provide a high level of stability, consistency, reliability, and longevity
