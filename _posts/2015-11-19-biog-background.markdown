My IT experience has been almost entirely tactical and pragmatic, supporting Fortune 500 organizations.  By "supporting", I mean literally having spent the bulk of my career in support positions: operations support, data base support, systems support, applications support -- generally 24 x 7 on call rotations, appeasing the fright induced by critical components and applications going bump in in the night.

Most of my career has been devoted to responding to issues that start with a problem that is new and different, and for which I need to learn on the fly.
    
I've supported both production issues and applications, and developers.  In the development arena, I've watched fads come and go, and I've endured enthusiastic, heartfelt proclamations about how the latest acronym (or more recently, non-acronym) is going to obsolete everything I know, most often to be silenced with nary a ripple in the pond.
    
Along the way, I've certainly done development. I've been curious about every new language and tool that I've come in contact with, and there has always been some tool that I needed to improve routine administrative or metrics gathering or whatever.  "If you have to do it more than three times, automate it!" 
   
I have been in pure application development positions including a chunk in Enterprise Bus/messaging development, and in doing freelance work, some front end work.  My current production support position involves about 20% of time doing development.
   
About 85% of my paid experience has been on the MVS-z/OS platform.  That gives me a perspective that I find valuable -- seeing that there isn't much new and different across platforms.  Such a simple concept is lost on folks who have a narrow exposure to cross-platform activities.  Even some who have Windows and *nix go into a paralysis when confronted with the dreaded "mainframe".  Hey, its just software, guys.  I could teach it to you in a day... Maybe two.
