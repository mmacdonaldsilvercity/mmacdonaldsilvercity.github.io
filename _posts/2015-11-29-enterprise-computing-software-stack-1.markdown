title: Enterprise Computing: Software Stack #1

What is the most viable software stack upon which a new enterprise computing platform should be built?

Well, that is nearly impossible to answer on a couple levels, first of which is that enterprise computing evolves,  it doesn't get chosen.  Secondly, the software landscape is so totally fractured and dynamic that it is kind of like predicting which weed in a field will get biggest.

Pretending like I'm some highly paid architectural consultant, and tasked with this question, I do have an answer, for better or worse: I think Javascript has legs, even for enterprise computing.

Part of the challenge in choosing a long term platform is in knowing that software developers and technicians will be required to do ongoing maintenance, new development, and system administration.  Javascript has an edge here in two ways;  there is a wealth of developers who are very adept in the language; and, given the use of node.js, the entire language stack from end to end is the same language.  

This eases shifting of development resources around, whether using trusted outsourcing firms, temp contractors, or in house hires.  Being able to move bodies around within the set of existing relationships rather than a panicked last minute search for talent is a very big deal indeed.

Granted, a strictly front end developer would have a learning curve going into a back end project.  But one of the characteristics of enterprise computing is that no developer is an island, and everyone gets exposed to a lot of different software technologies if they stick around long enough.  So, that learning curve isn't onerous for an in-house developer.  And for the outsourcing or contracting solutions, in many cases the same resources can be repurposed without too much time and energy lost in adapting to a new administrative and management environment.

In later posts I'll describe the specific technologies I chose and how the experiments to validate viability went.
