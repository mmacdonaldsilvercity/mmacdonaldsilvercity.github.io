Really good software developers are Farmers.<br/>
Really good software support and maintenance technicians are Hunters.<br/>
Superprogrammers have traits of both Hunters and Farmers.<br/>

I'm a really good support guy.<br/>
I'm in awe of Superprogrammers.    

Truth be known, I've not run into many Superprogrammers in the Fortune 500 IT world.  I've seen a couple, but generally their output was way over the heads of their colleagues, and way beyond the ability of a non-software business to maintain long-term -- for the most part Superprogrammers don't want to go to work for non-software industry organizations, and don't want to be in creativity-suppressing big organizations.  Superprogrammers created cool stuff, then left, and eventually their neat output replaced with out of the box software, as software vendors caught up with a need and filled it.  

In addition to Superprogrammers, since doing the bits of freelancing that I've done, I've run across a super-set of that class:  The Super-Individuals.  ... Midas-touch people, who become acknowledged experts at everything they touch, make lots of money and/or have lots of freedom, and are entertaining and articulate in conversation.  Damn.  More than in awe of them:  Are those folks even the same species that I am?  Nonetheless, I always feel blessed when coming into contact with someone like that; glad to have the opportunity to see what the human spirit can create given a good attitude and a bit of luck (which admittedly might include luck of the draw in the genetic pool...)
