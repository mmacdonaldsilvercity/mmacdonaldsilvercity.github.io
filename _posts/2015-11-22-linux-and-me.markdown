I first installed linux on a clunky, outdated household desktop around 2006 or so. Started on Fedora, but soon hit the harder stuff... 

I was laid off in 2008 and had some time on my hands.  In between the job search activities, I installed Arch Linux and started learning more about administering linux, on the desktop anyway.  

Since then I've jumped around, tried Puppy Linux for a while, spent a long time with Ubuntu variants, but have come back to Arch-derived distros, and mythinks here I will stay.  Got Antergos on one box, Manjaro on another -- the quick installs are a blessing, but nothing I've tried beats the Arch platform in any category I can think of -- including the all-important set of documentation.

Maybe I'll write something more extensive on the value of current software at another point, but for now:  A rolling release makes for the most advanced and capable use of computing resources.
